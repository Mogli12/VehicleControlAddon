## Newest features
Snap direction has been renamed to **lane guidance**.
It is possible to swtich to left or right reverse guidance lane. Here are the lane guidance key bindings:
* LCtrl+W: (de-)activate lane  guidane on nearest lane
* LCtrl+LAlt+W: detect width and offset of attached implements
* LAlt+W: Disable lane guidance
* LCtrl+A / LCtrl+D: shift by one lane to the left / right
* LAlt+A / LAlt+D: switch to left / right reverse lane. You can specify the number of lanes to skip in the settings menu. There is no need to deactivate lane guidance for the turn. If you change direction, then the vehicle should steer into the right direction. If you deactivated guidance steering, then you can use LCtrl+S to reactivate it.
* LCtrl+S: Reactivate last guidance lane

## Some settings are display only in MP

In multiplayer games only the master user (aka administrator) can change global settings with key combination LCtrl+LAtr+C.

## modSettings

Global settings are stored in the savegame and in modSettings/vehicleControlAddon.xml. Dedi servers will save the global settings in the savegame only.

## Motivation
Although I have a steering wheel, but almost always play with the keyboard. On winding roads, I am again and again landed in the ditch in front of nights or power poles.
